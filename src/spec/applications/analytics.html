<h1 id="anonymous-analytics">Anonymous Analytics</h1>
<p>Analytic collection is usually non-respecting of privacy, but it should be possible to create a system of analytics that reveals as little identifying information as possible using information theory and the decentralized nature of Dither.</p>
<h2 id="rough-idea">Rough Idea</h2>
<p>Author specifies what kind of analytics they want and how specific they want. <em>Analytics must be proportions or averages</em>. Users manually (or automatically based on settings) pick which fields they want to divulge. Peers that use a specific application are identified and an agreed upon field is set to be exchanged and averaged by each peer. Each peer checks the other’s proof of humanity (see <a href="../dither/zero-knowledge-proofs.html">zero-knowledge-proofs</a>) and create a new zero-knowledge proof combining the ones of each peer.</p>
<p>This part needs more thought:</p>
<p>This field combination is done with many different peers until all of a given peer’s fields have been combined. Then more averages are produced and a tree of proofs is gradually built. until the top of the tree for each field contains the desired average or proportion which is publically viewable for all users to see.</p>
