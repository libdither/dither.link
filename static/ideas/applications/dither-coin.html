<h1 id="dither-coin">Dither Coin</h1>
<p>Dither’s built-in cryptocurrency meant to solve all existing problems with crypto: - Scalability - Uses IOTA block structure combined with Federated Byzantine Voting for coordination. - Most users won’t store the entire network history, just the current state. - Speed - Using Stellar Consensus Protocol and IOTA will be helpful to speed. - Bad Idea?: Also, there will be establishment of Zones in the network that have their own sub-exchanging separate from the rest of the network for fast local transactions. Usage of zones will be faster than sending transactions to the global network, however, for security purposes, zones must report transactions - Anonymity - Will use zk-STARKS to obfuscate transaction amounts and sender - Transaction Cost - Network is maintained by users, no mining necessary - Volatility - There will be a system of provable currency deletion where you can create Dither Coins from thin air by proving that you send a certain amount of other support crypto coins to a public key with no corresponding private key (i.e. proving that they are inaccessable). The amount of coins created will be market exchange rate of the given coin into the U.S. dollar at the time of the transaction. (exchange rate is maintained by the network) - <strong>This will ensure that the value of Dithercoin is tied to the US dollar.</strong> - Ease of Use - Dither Coin will be built-in to all aspects of Dither for tipping and other things - There will be SDKs so that Dither Coin can be built into other applications. - Ease of Purchase - A system for peer-to-peer purchase of Dither Coin using other assets will be created using Dither Chain. (Idea WIP)</p>
