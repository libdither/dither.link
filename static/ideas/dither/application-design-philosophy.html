<h1 id="application-design-philosophy">Application Design Philosophy</h1>
<p>Application APIs should be future-proofed as much as possible</p>
<p>Application GUIs should be generally be as cross platform as possible.</p>
<p>There should be different modes of use for different user skill levels to try and accomidate as many people as possible. - These modes should enable/disable various aspects of <em>configurability</em> in the application - Simple mode should be super easy to use for anyone and come with a quick tutorial - Configuration options should be assumed as much as possible, - Default mode should come with a tutorial and explain how modes work and how to change them - Advanced mode assumes the user already knows how to use the app or can figure it out on their own. All configurability functionality should be enabled. - Application developers should strive to implement as much configurability as possible into every aspect of their application for complex users. - For desktop applications, configuration on a small level (for specific contextual buttons or features) could be shown through right-click menus. - For mobile applications these configuration items can be shown through a long-press.</p>
