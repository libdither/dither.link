<h1 id="reverse-hash-lookup-wip">Reverse Hash Lookup (WIP)</h1>
<p>Allows for finding what structures link to a given structure.</p>
<p>Example: Someone can find a comment that links to a post, just given the hash of the post.</p>
<h2 id="general-structure">General Structure</h2>
<p>A Binary Tree stored on <a href="./directional-trail-search.html">DTS</a> that maps binary data of a hash to object that contains a link to the hash. The top hash of the structure is agreed upon through Federated Byzantine Agreement.</p>
<h2 id="specific-structure">Specific Structure</h2>
<h3 id="traits">Traits</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Node&lt;T, L&gt;</code> - Nodes of the tree</p>
<ul>
<li><code>subnodes: List&lt;T, L&gt;</code> - subnodes of this node</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>Leaf</code> -</p></li>
<li><p>This is a system by which one can find structures that link to a given hash implementing the reverse trait.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is some pieces of data that links from or adds useful defintions to a given piece of data, this is the place for it. One example of this in practice might be having a comment thread. Each comment is its own Hashstruct that contains the hash of the post or a replying comment. In order for someone who has the post structure to find the comments, they would need find all the pieces of data linking to this piece of data (i.e. a Reverse Hash Lookup)</p></li>
<li><p>To implement this system, there will be a partial binary tree represented by a DAG that can be traversed using the data of the target. (i.e. the post structure’s hash). Then the tree can be traversed down using consecutive trail searches. Until a list of all known linked hashes is found. These structures must contain a specific trait called a RevHash to be able to be validated onto the distributed tree. The addition of new links to this tree is done through an implementation of Dither Chain Consensus (see the <a href="#dither-consensus-chains">#Dither Consensus Chains</a> section).</p></li>
