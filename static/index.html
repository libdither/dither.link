	<h3>What Is Dither</h2>
	<p>Dither is a project that aims to recreate the entirety of the Internet such that it is decentralized, democratized, and privacy respecting. This means no centralized servers, no single organization control, no censorship, and no surveilance by companies or governments.</p>

	<h3>Structure</h3>
	<p>Dither is built in swappable layers. The first layer is the peer-to-peer transport. It allows for different Dither clients to establish direct connections with each other. The next layer is the core part of Dither. It provides modular encryption, data storage, account management, packet routing, and many other components that are needed to make fully-fledged internet applications. The next layer is the application API layer. Any application built on Dither must have a standard API so that multiple different methods of user interaction can be implemented for different people's workflows. This API contains self-defined structures and application code written in a system language (like Rust). The final layer is the User Interface Program. It implements a GUI or CLI or some other creative use of the API to make a usable program. For example a chat app with a standard API would have different user interfaces for different platforms. It might also have a command-line interface for people who like CLIs as well as some other program that only uses a fraction of the full API (perhaps a widget that displays how many people are in a public chat server). This modularity is extremely valuable to create interoperable applications applicable to everyone's usecases.</p>

	<h3>Core Tenants</h3>
	<p><i>Dither should be as modular as possible.</i></p>
	<p><i>Dither protocols and formats should be interoperable with existing protocols and formats to make transition to Dither as easy as possible.</i></p>
	<p><i>Dither should rely on itself as much as possible.</i></p>
	<p>Dither's Core Tenants can be found in full <a href="/ideas/dither.html#core-tenants">here</a>.</p>
	<h3>Roadmap</h3>
	<p>Currently, Dither is the simulation phase. Various core parts of Dither are being tested in the <a href="https://github.com/libdither/dbr-sim">dbr-sim</a> repository.</p>
