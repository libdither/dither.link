		<p>Mission: Decentralize the Internet</p>
	</div>
	<p>The current state of decentralizing the internet is a big fragmented mess of different protocols and applications trying to do different things, but not effectively enough. Not enough ideas are shared, not enough people are talking. The biggest usage of peer-to-peer tech is bittorrent, which has been around for 2 decades. As freedoms are continually encroached upon, having a decentralized and democratic internet is more important than ever before.</p>

	<h3>Projects That have inspired Dither</h3>
	<p><a href="https://multiformats.io/">Multiformats</a> - Multiformats aims to fix the problem of future-proofing systems into future ages of computing. Dither will use a few of the multiformats, such as multihash, to future-proof and to be compatible with IPFS</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.stellar.org/">Stellar Conensus Protocol</a> - Byzantine Federated Voting is a really fast system for consensus, it just has to be implemented well.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a> - Monero is the only cryptocurrency that actually has most of what a crypto <i>currency</i> should have. Transactions are completely anonymous, transaction fees are very low and it's not managed by a single company. </h3>
	Dither will improve on this with its own suite of cryptocurrency
	<p><a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> - IPFS is a core project in the current stage of Web3, and a really good start to a decentralized internet. But it is simply too slow and hard to interface with. (<a href="https://www.publish0x.com/ecosystem-overviews-and-analysis/the-precarious-state-of-ipfs-in-the-year-2020-xmvxeg">The Precarious State of IPFS</a>) - Dither's <a href="/ideas/dither.html#locating-data-directional-trail-search">Directed Trail Search</a> will greatly improve the speed at which data can flow across the network. It also improves on IPFS by allowing for permissioned data access.
	<p>DNS - The Domain Name System is a very old piece of the internet, but it is unfortunately centralized. There have been various attempts at block-chainifying. A replacement system for naming things will be built on top of the <a href="/ideas/dither/reverse-hash-lookup.html">Reverse Hash Lookup</a> system.</p>
